# React component storybook with Typescript boilerplate

This boiler plate has been created by just adding the main dependencies:

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
npx @storybook/cli sb init
yarn add styled-components
yarn add -D @types/styled-components
```

And some cleanup of `package.json`.

Run `yarn install` and then `yarn storybook`.
